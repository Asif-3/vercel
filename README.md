# elampillai-sarees
Generated Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind starter project for the Elampillai Sarees app.

## How to run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:5173

## Notes
- The full Elampillai app component should be placed in `src/ElampillaiApp.tsx`. Currently this project contains a placeholder component.
- If you want, reply "inject full" and I will replace the placeholder with the full app code split into proper TypeScript files.
